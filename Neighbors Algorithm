Neighbors Algorithm

Example Maze:
- Columns: 10
- Rows: 6

Example Tile Number 12:
- Top Neighbor: tile_number - columns
- Bottom Neighbor: tile_number + columns
- Left Neighbor: tile_number - 1 ( check if it's in the same row )
- Right Neighbor: tile_number + 1 ( check if it's in the same row )

Sort Randomly a Neighbor:
- if Top: remove top wall from current tile and bottom wall from sorted neighbor
- if Bottom: remove bottom wall from current tile and top wall from sorted neighbor
- if Left: remove left wall from current tile and right wall from sorted neighbor
- if Right: remove right wall from current tile and left wall from sorted neighbor
